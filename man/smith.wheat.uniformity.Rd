\details{

  Experiment was grown in Canberra, Australia, 1934.
  
  The data are the yield of grain per plot and the number of "ears".
  Each plot was 1 foot long by 0.5 foot.
  
  Field width: 36 columns x 1 foot = 36 feet.

  Field length: 30 rows x 0.5 foot = 15 feet.

  Notes:

  There are 2 copies of the yield data at Rothamsted library.
  Let Copy A be the one with dark, hand-drawn grid lines, and Copy B be
  the one without hand-drawn grid lines. Both copies are hand-written,
  likely copied from the original data.
  
  For row 4 (from top) column 34: Copy A has yield 164 while Copy B has
  yield 154. The value of 154 appears to be correct, since it leads to
  the same row and column totals as shown on both Copy A and Copy B.
  
  For row 20, column 28, both Copy A and Copy B show yield 283. This
  appears to be a copy error. We replaced the value 283 by 203, so that
  the row and column totals match the values on both Copy A and Copy B,
  and also the variance of the data matches the value in Smith (1938),
  which is 2201 on page 7.

  The documents at Rothamsted claim that the grain yield is shown as
  "Yields of grain in decigrams per foot length".  However, we believe
  that that actual unit of weight is grams. Note that the yield values
  in the high-yielding parts of the field are close to 200 g per plot,
  and a plot is 0.5 sq feet.  Multiply by 8 to get 1600 g per 4 sq
  feet. In Smith's paper, the fertility contour map in figure 1 shows
  the high-yielding part of the field having a yield close to
  "16 d.kg per 4 sq ft", and 16 d.kg = 16 kg = 1600 g.
  
  This data was made available with special help from the staff at
  Rothamsted Research Library.
